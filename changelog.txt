Changes made:

1. using normal `char` instead of `unsigned char` for character of a base64 
   encoded value. They are ascii characters and so they should be `char`.

2. using `uint8_t` instead of `unsigend char` when dealing with bytes. It's 
   better to use such kind of standards because they are guaranteed to be 8 bit.

3. using `size_t` or `ssize_t`instead of `unsigned int` when dealing with 
   lengths.It's better because it'll be the same used in string libraries when 
   building across different architectures (e.g. Arduino).

4. using doxygen standard tags in comments for documentation of the functions.

5. divided implementations from declaration using a cpp file. This prevents the 
   error of redefinition of functions if the library is used in different files
   in a project. 
   N.B. for one line functions I'm using the `inline` keyword 

6. using `const char *` instead of `unsigend char[]` when dealing with strings.
   that is important to allow the user to pass a literal string to the function.

7. using default parameters value in functions when possible.
